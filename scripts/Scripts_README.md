# Scripts Directory README

This directory contains scripts and related resources for various languages and tools used in this project. Please follow the guidelines below when contributing or modifying scripts.

## Rules
- Organize scripts by language or tool in their respective subfolders (e.g., `python/`, `go/`, `java/`).
- Use clear, descriptive filenames and add comments to explain script functionality.
- Test scripts before submitting a pull request.
- Keep scripts cross-platform where possible (e.g., provide both `.sh` and `.ps1` for shell scripts).
- Do not include sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.) in any script.
- Update this README with any new contributions or changes.

## TODOs
- [ ] Add more automation scripts for common developer tasks.
- [ ] Improve documentation for each script and subfolder.
- [ ] Add usage examples for each script.
- [ ] Review and refactor existing scripts for consistency.
